\section intro_sot-pattern-generator Introduction

This package wraps the walk pattern generator exposed by walkGenJrl (package
jrl-walkgen) for use in the stack of tasks. Hence, by using this package, you
can create several \ref dynamicgraph::Entity "entities" to control the walk
pattern of a humanoid robot.

\section req Requirements
This package has the following dependencies:
\li jrl-walkgen
\li jrl-dynamics
\li sot-core
\li hrp2Dynamics [optional]
\li hrp2-10-small [optional]

To download and install these packages, please visit
https://github.com/jrl-umi3218.

\section overview API overview
As most packages based on the dynamic-graph framework (see
https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/dynamic-graph), the functionality is exposed
through entities. Hence .so or .dll (dynamic-link) libraries are generated in
the dynamic-graph plugins directory.

The following entities are created by this package:\n
(all entites are placed in the namespace sot::)
\li sot::PatternGenerator
\li (to be continued)

See each entity's documentation page for more information (when available).
